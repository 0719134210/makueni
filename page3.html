                    <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">Kivutha Kibwana is a Kenyan politician and human rights activist. He was the spokesperson of National Convention Executive Council (NCEC) from 1997 to 2002.  
<br>In 2002, he became a Member of Parliament for Makueni Constituency, and Minister of both Lands, settlements, Environment &amp; Natural Resources. 
<br>In January 2008, he was appointed as Presidential Advisor for Constitutional, Parliamentary &amp; Youth Affairs in the President Office and served until September 2012. He formed Muungano Development Movement Party (MDM) &nbsp;During the Kenyan general elections of 2013, Prof. Kibwana was elected as the first Governor of Makueni County under the Muungano Development Movement Party which he was leading. Disagreements with majority of members of Makueni County Assembly who belonged to the Wiper Democratic Movement Party had him consider resigning from the position of Governor in the same year he was elected. While Prof. Kibwana did not resign, a petition was filed to suspend Makueni County citing that the Kibwana led Executive and the Assembly were operating at extreme levels of disagreement. The sharp disagreements persisted to the extent that a commission appointed by President Uhuru Kenyatta recommended the dissolution of the county government. The commission's recommendation was overruled by President Kenyatta. In the final financial year of Prof. Kibwana's first term as Governor, Makueni county registered an unspent development budget amounting to 1.5 Billion Kenya Shillings (about 15 million US Dollars). 
<br>In 2017, Professor Kibwana's Muungano party entered a pre-election pact with the Wiper Democratic Movement Party. Kibwana was appointed Chairman of the Wiper Democratic Movement Party. Professor Kibwana was subsequently re-elected as Makueni Governor for a second term as Governor for Makueni County at the 2017 general elections. One year after being elected, Kibwana fell out with Kalonzo Musyoka, the Wiper Democratic Movement Party Leader. This led to admonishment of Prof. Kibwana by other politicians belonging to the Wiper party. The fall out culminated in an announcement by Kalonzo Musyoka that the agreement between Muungano Party and the Wiper Party had expired. Prof. Kibwana also claimed that he would have been re-elected regardless of the pre-election pact with the Wiper party[18]. In July 2019, Prof. Kivutha was replaced as Chairman of the Wiper party by Chirau Ali Mwakwere. 
<br>the Auditor General's Office for the financial year 2017/18 ranked Prof. Kibwana's Makueni Government alongside Nyandarua County Government as the best in the use of public funds. &nbsp;<br></p>
